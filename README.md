## Introduction

OpenYurt is the industry's first edge computing platform that is non-intrusive to cloud-native systems.
It unifies the management of massive scattered heterogeneous edge resources, such as CDN sites, IoT all-in-one machines, and other edge computing power,
from a central control point located either in the cloud or in a central server room. 

OpenYurt facilitates users in seamlessly executing large-scale application delivery, operation, maintenance, and control of massive edge resources.

## How can I get involved?

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](https://openyurt.io/docs/developer-manuals/how-to-contribute/) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Akind%2Fgood-first-issue) or the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels.

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using OpenYurt.
