## Member

Members are continuously active contributors in the community. They can have issues and PRs assigned to them. Members are expected to remain active contributors to the community.

### Requirements

- Have made multiple contributions to the project or community. Contribution may include, but is not limited to:
    - Authoring or reviewing PRs on GitHub
    - Filing or commenting on issues on GitHub

- Responsive to issues and PRs assigned to them
- Active owner of code they have contributed (unless ownership is explicitly transferred)
    - Code is well tested
    - Tests consistently pass
    - Addresses bugs or issues discovered after code is accepted

## Reviewer

## Approver

Code approvers are able to both review and approve code contributions. While code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is focused on holistic acceptance of a contribution including: backwards / forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc.

### Requirements

- Primary reviewer for a number of substantial PRs to the codebase
- Sponsored by 2 maintainers and with no objections from other maintainers

- During GitHub issue classification, apply all applicable [labels](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/labels)
  to each new issue. Labels are extremely useful for follow-up of future issues. Which labels to apply
  is somewhat subjective so just use your best judgment.
- Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them if they are not
  moving in a productive direction.
- Participate when called upon in the security release process. Note
  that although this should be a rare occurrence, if a serious vulnerability is found, the process
  may take up to several full days of work to implement.

## Inactive members

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active
participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time, and
they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

Therefore, members with an extended period away from the project with no activity
will be removed from the OpenYurt GitHub Organizations and will be required to
go through the org membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves
with the current state.

### How inactivity is measured

Inactive members are defined as members of one of the OpenYurt Organizations
with **no** contributions across any organization within **6 months**. This is
measured by the CNCF [DevStats project].

**Note:** DevStats does not take into account non-code contributions. If a
non-code contributing member is accidentally removed this way, they may open an
issue to quickly be re-instated.

After an extended period away from the project with no activity,
those members would need to re-familiarize themselves with the current state
before being able to contribute effectively.
